# Amazon Music Clustering 🎵

An end-to-end unsupervised learning project that groups songs based on their audio characteristics to uncover hidden patterns in music — enabling smart playlist generation, genre discovery, and recommendation insights.

## 🚀 Project Overview

With millions of songs available, manually categorizing tracks into genres or moods is inefficient.
This project applies machine learning clustering techniques (like K-Means) on Amazon Music audio features to automatically group similar songs based on sound attributes such as energy, tempo, danceability, and valence.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Group similar songs into meaningful clusters based on audio features.
- Identify dominant musical patterns like Party, Chill, Instrumental, etc.
- Visualize relationships among songs using PCA and clustering plots.
- Enable insights for recommendation systems, playlist curation, and music analytics.

## 🚀 Key Steps

- Data Cleaning & Feature Scaling  
- Feature Selection  
- K-Means Clustering (Elbow & Silhouette)  
- Cluster Interpretation & Visualization (PCA, Heatmaps, Distributions)

## 🧠 Skills Used

Python · Pandas · scikit-learn · Matplotlib · Seaborn · PCA · Clustering

## 📁 Outputs

- clustered dataset  
- Visual plots (PCA scatter, bar charts, heatmaps)
  
## 🏁 Results

- Built an end-to-end unsupervised ML pipeline for audio-based clustering.
- Created interpretable song clusters for real-world use cases.
- Demonstrated mastery in EDA, K-Means, PCA, and data visualization.
